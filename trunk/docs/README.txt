What is it? 
-----------
  
NModelRS is a remote stepper for NModel, enabling model-based testing 
of implementations in other languages than C#, in particular Java. 

The distribution contains
  - a .NET remote stepper for use with NModel's ct tool
  - a Java NModel sync and async stepper communicating with 
    the .NET remote stepper over TCP and UDP
  - a Java NModel stepper for executing testsuites 
    generated by NModel's otg tool
  - an ATM example with a model and a Java test harness for
    the GUI ATMExample simulation
  - an SP example demonstrating the async remote stepper
